    <p class="eurowind-description">Eurowind is a leading force in the renewable energy sector, 
        tracing its roots back to 1977 when Ove Rasmussen, an electrician, 
        erected a modified Riisager mill on his property. This marked the 
        beginning of a family legacy, with sons Søren and Jens inheriting
        the passion for wind energy. In 2006, along with lawyer Jakob Kortbæk, 
        they founded Eurowind Energy. The company, headquartered in Hobro, Denmark, 
        manages approximately 1,450 MW of wind and solar parks.</p>

    <h4>Inheritors of a Green Legacy</h4>
    <p>The Rasmussen brothers, influenced by their father's involvement in Denmark's 
        Wind Turbine Association, ventured into the wind energy business. Søren, 
        starting as a farmer, and Jens, as an electrician turned consultant, shared 
        a common entrepreneurial spirit. Their entry into the German wind market in 2006, 
        taking advantage of favorable conditions, laid the foundation for Eurowind's growth.</p>
    
     
    
    <h4>From Germany to Global Leadership</h4>

        <p>Eurowind strategically entered the German wind market, capitalizing on 
            differences in depreciation policies. The brothers, joined by Jakob Kortbæk, 
            formed Eurowind Energy in 2006. Their early foray into Germany and later 
            Poland provided a competitive edge and set the stage for Eurowind's expansion. 
            The company diversified to countries like Portugal, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and 
            Bulgaria, becoming a major player in both wind and solar energy.</p>

    <h4>Homecoming to Denmark</h4>
    
    <p class="eurowind-description">With a shift in Danish political climate in 2008, Eurowind returned to Denmark, 
        transitioning from being buyers to developers in the local wind energy sector. 
        The company's growth continued with acquisitions, including the merger with Eniig Renewables 
        in 2019, expanding their business to the UK and Germany.</p>
